In this lab, we explore the impact of central clearing on derivative contracts, specifically contrasting Exchange-Traded Derivatives (ETDs) like futures with Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives like forwards. The application aims to provide a practical tool for risk managers, compliance officers, and institutional finance students to understand how margin requirements and daily settlement reduce cash flow and price differences between these contract types.
